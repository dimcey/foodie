# "Foodi" developed project for NASA Space apps challenge 2015 in Helsinki

Foodi is a web application that maps the food production and distribution across the globe. Aiming to show the current capacity and potential of countries to be self-sufficient in the provision of food for their populations for the future years. In adition, Foodi allows users to share and read stories behind food imports and exports of the each country based on FAOs World statistics.  

This project is solving the Food Directions challenge. It servers to identify and visualize the current capacity and potential of countries to be self-sufficient in the provision of food for their populations, and to map how current global food needs are met through reliance on international food trade.

Using a cool map based web tool, educators, investors, scientists and decision makers can see the food production and distribution across the world to tackle the world food in sustainable ways. An improved and interactive understanding of where our food is grown, and where it ends up, could influence everyone in and our of our planet.
In addition, this platform is highly social, allowing users to comment, like and discuss about their local food related events, creating a transparent platform for intergalactic citizen communication.
